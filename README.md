## jsondiff : Chrome/Firefox extension for jsondiff.com  

I regularly use jsondiff.com for comparing JSON documents however I have to have internet connectivity everytime I use, as it is a web page. 

So I decided to build a web extension which works offline and easily accessible on a button click.  
In addition to that I've removed the underscore.js and in a process of removing jQuery too which will reduce the size the extension. I will update the extension once it is approved.

Extension is available at   
chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-diff/dmndidoancoefdoobhbmjgignfimpmpj  
firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/json-diff/  
  
Below is the extension screenshot
